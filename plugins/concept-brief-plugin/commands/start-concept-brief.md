Start a Concept Brief session for Kerten Hospitality. Follow these steps exactly.

## 1. Check for an existing brief

Look in the current working directory for any file matching `concept-brief-*.md`.

- If one or more files are found: list them and ask the user "Would you like to resume one of these, or start a new brief?"
  - If resuming: read the file, identify the last confirmed section, tell the user where you are picking up from, and begin from the next section. Skip steps 2 and 3 below.
  - If starting new: proceed to step 2.
- If no file is found: proceed to step 2.

## 2. Display the session overview

Present the following to the user — keep it tight, no preamble:

**Concept Brief — Session Overview**

I'll start by asking you to fill in a short form — 11 fields covering the property, owner, and asset. Once submitted, I'll run market and owner research, then auto-draft all remaining sections for you to review and confirm. Everything gets saved to a running artifact file (`concept-brief-[property-name].md`) in this directory. You can stop at any time and resume later — just run `/start-concept-brief` again and I'll pick up where we left off.

You can view our progress of the information we save on the right pane.

**What I'll ask you:**

| # | Section | |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Property Metadata | Required |
| 2 | Owner Context | Required |
| 3 | Asset Assessment | Required |
| 4 | Insider Knowledge & Relationships | Optional |

All remaining sections — Competitive Set & Market Dynamics, Positioning Thesis, Concept Direction, Key Messages, Experience Inventory, Financial Anchors, Commercial Terms, Design Direction, Phasing, Partners & Collaborators, and Open Questions — are auto-drafted from your answers and research, then presented to you for review.

If the user uploaded an RFP or brief document: pre-populate every field you can answer confidently from it, leaving blanks only where the document is silent. Mark pre-populated fields clearly so the user knows what was extracted.

Once submitted, hand off to the concept-briefing skill to run research and auto-draft all sections.
